# Geolocation-Aware Demo Applications with Redis

This repository provides some exercises around Redis commands that are related to geospatial search.

This repository is just sharing the exercises of the 'Geolocation-Aware Applications with Redis' training. The learning objectives of the entire training are:

- Know how Geo-aware solutions are used and which problems are addressed by them
- Understand and be able to present the technology basics
- Understand the technical details of the Redis Geo* commands and their approach to support geo-spatial use cases
- Understand the data modeling basics
- Get insights how geo-spatial solutions are implemented with traditional vendors
- Know where to find additional resources about how to implement location-aware applications with Redis
